- I´ve created my first service worker and turned my website into a Progressive Web App :-). After doing some precaching for static resources (JavaScript, CSS, Google Fonts), and providing a Web App Manifest (big name for this little thing), it´s now possible to put an icon of the site on the homescreen of a smartphone. That´s not all of course. The interaction is much faster due to the precaching, and further improvements will come. I think of offline readability and improved runtime caching for images for example. It´s an exciting start.
